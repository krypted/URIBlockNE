# URIBlockNE
A network extension app to block a user input URI. Meant as a network extension filter proof of concept.

This is a proof of concept. It pull in a number of different projects, most notably Sift-ios (https://github.com/agrinman/sift-ios) and AwesomeCache (https://github.com/aschuch/AwesomeCache). Therefore I'm not licensing out my work but please be careful to adhere to their licenses if used for anything other than research. 

## What it does
This app simply presents a user with a text input and based on the text provided blocks access to the site using a network extension. Compiling will require the entitlement and the developer team in the Xcode project will need to be set to your own. Here's what that looks like:
